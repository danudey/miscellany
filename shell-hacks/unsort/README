UNSORT
------

A simple script. Un-sorts (randomizes) the lines in a file. Prints
results to standard out.

Usage: unsort <filename> > resultfile

Note: The contents of the file are stored in an in-memory list (but
only one copy!). I may in the future do something crazy like adding
in support for memory-mapping the file, but that just gets complicated.
