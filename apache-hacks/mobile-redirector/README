Mobile Redirector

This is a simple Apache snippet that can be included into your configuration
to provide for automatic redirection from your main website to a mobile site.

The behaviour goes as such:
    - If you request a WAP profile; or
    - If your Accept string includes 'wap'; or
    - If your user-agent matches a long list of probably-mobile substrings; then
    - You are redirected (301) from /<anything> to http://<mobile-site>/<anything>;
    - UNLESS
        - Your user-agent does not match a short list of probably-not-mobile substrings; or
        - Your HTTP referer is from the mobile site (i.e. you are coming back from mobile); or
        - Your HTTP referer is from the current site (i.e. you are browsing the current site)

This configuration requires the following Apache modules:
    mod_rewrite
    mod_setenvif

TODO:
    - Add cookie support (check for a specific cookie and never redirect if present)
